# Daily Agent Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Generated by:** Master Agent — Orchestrator
**Version:** v5 (routine re-audit — same day)

---

## Executive Summary

Fifth audit of the day following agent onboarding and remediation cycles. The ecosystem continues to mature: **Dr. Vinnie Boombatz generated its first real output** (supplement protocol document), **Dewey Cheatem's output directories were created**, and **X-Posts consumed 3 scheduled posts** confirming continued daily usage. No new agents discovered. Ecosystem score rises to **7.4/10** (up from 7.3) as the two new agents begin showing early signs of utilization. The stale RULES.md in Ridgemont Studio Website remains the top outstanding issue.

## Overall Ecosystem Score: 7.4/10

## New Agents Discovered

None. Ecosystem stable at 13 folders (11 active + 2 deprecated).

---

## Cross-Agent Analysis

### Overlap Detection
1. **Frozen Cloud Website ↔ Ridgemont Studio Website**: Both serve web presences. Low overlap, low-priority merge candidate.
2. **Make-Music ↔ Suno Prompt Generator**: Complementary with clear boundary (Make-Music defers to SPG for production prompts).

### Gap Detection
1. **No financial/business operations agent** — Ridgemont Studio has no dedicated accounting or business agent
2. **No project management / task tracking agent** — cross-agent coordination is manual
3. **No social media analytics agent** — X-Posts creates content but doesn't measure performance

### Merge Candidates
| Pair | Score | Priority | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Frozen Cloud Website + Ridgemont Studio Website | 5.8 | Low | Different acts; only merge if FC site is retired |

### Split Candidates
None. All agents appropriately scoped.

---

## Priority Recommendations
1. **HIGH:** Update Ridgemont Studio Website RULES.md — stale tracks.json references persist across 3 audit cycles
2. **HIGH:** Install CourtListener MCP for dewey-cheatem-esq to enable case law research
3. **MEDIUM:** Delete ~$ temp lock file from dr-vinnie-boombatz
4. **MEDIUM:** Add .gitignore to Make Videos root (exclude node_modules/)
5. **LOW:** Delete Suno Trainer folder entirely
6. **LOW:** Delete _deprecated-park-bellevue-portal folder entirely
7. **LOW:** Delete frozen-cloud-portal/venv/ (recreatable from requirements.txt)

---

## Action Items
