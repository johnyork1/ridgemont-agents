# Daily Agent Audit Report
**Date:** February 8, 2026 (v2 — Post-Remediation Re-Audit)
**Generated by:** Master Agent — Orchestrator
**Previous Audit:** February 8, 2026 (v1 — Initial Full Audit + Remediation)

---

## Executive Summary

Three high-impact issues from the inaugural audit have been resolved: x-content duplication eliminated, portals merged into a unified multi-act codebase, and RULES.md added to the top 3 priority agents. Ecosystem health improved from 6.6 to 7.2/10. Remaining work centers on cleanup (residual X_Content files in Make Videos, empty tracks.json in Ridgemont Studio Website) and the medium-priority Suno Prompt Generator / Suno Trainer merge.

## Overall Ecosystem Score: 7.2/10 (↑ from 6.6 initial, ↓ from 7.3 post-remediation estimate)

*Note: The 7.3 post-remediation estimate was optimistic. This re-audit applies stricter scrutiny to data quality issues discovered during the deep scan.*

## Agent-by-Agent Status

### Agent: Frozen Cloud Website
- **Folder:** `Frozen Cloud Website/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 5.0/10
  - Clarity: 2/10 — No rules file. No agent instructions whatsoever.
  - Scope: 9/10 — Single purpose: static landing page. Well-contained.
  - Data Quality: 6/10 — Only 2 meaningful files (index.html + image). Clean but minimal.
  - Utilization: 2/10 — Last modified Jan 26. Rare use.
  - Effectiveness: 6/10 — The 935-line index.html is a complete, polished landing page.
- **Files:** 2 (index.html, FrozenCloud_02.jpg)
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** None
- **Issues Detected:**
  - No RULES.md — any Claude session working here has no context
  - Questionable whether this needs to be a standalone agent vs. a subfolder of Ridgemont Studio Website
- **Recommendations:**
  - Consider absorbing into Ridgemont Studio Website agent as a subdirectory
  - If kept standalone, add a minimal RULES.md defining purpose and deployment workflow

---

### Agent: Make Videos
- **Folder:** `Make Videos/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 7.0/10
  - Clarity: 7/10 — GAME_PLAN.md is comprehensive with clear redirect notices post-remediation.
  - Scope: 6/10 — Still covers YouTube daily show + Shorts + Remotion video + recording aids. Improved after x-content removal.
  - Data Quality: 6/10 — Residual X_Content/ directory still present with 4 files from Feb 5. MP4 video (TRBD_WeeterAndBlubby.mp4) in repo. node_modules committed.
  - Utilization: 9/10 — Daily use for YouTube content.
  - Effectiveness: 7/10 — Cardano Daily show workflow is functional with recording aids and GitHub Pages.
- **Files:** 49 (excluding node_modules)
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** GAME_PLAN.md (updated), x-content skill directory (deleted)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `YT_Content_Review/X_Content/2026-02-05/` — 4 residual files (text_posts.md, daily_thread.md, clip_scripts.md, engagement.md). These were generated before x-content was removed but the content directory wasn't cleaned up.
  - `my-video/out/TRBD_WeeterAndBlubby.mp4` — Large binary in the repo
  - `humanization_settings.md` — References the deleted x-content workflow. May need updating.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Delete or archive `YT_Content_Review/X_Content/` directory — it's orphaned
  - Move `my-video/out/*.mp4` to external storage or `.gitignore`
  - Review `humanization_settings.md` for stale references

---

### Agent: Make-Music
- **Folder:** `Make-Music/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 7.0/10
  - Clarity: 8/10 — New RULES.md is excellent: clear workflows, file naming conventions, folder structure.
  - Scope: 8/10 — Well-focused on songwriting, MIDI, chord sheets, and Suno prompt drafts.
  - Data Quality: 5/10 — 14 MIDI files in root directory (many are test files that should be in Tests/). No Tests/ subfolder exists despite RULES.md recommending one. Logic Pro project is properly nested.
  - Utilization: 6/10 — Weekly use.
  - Effectiveness: 7/10 — Produces usable MIDI and chord sheets. Strumming guide is solid.
- **Files:** 30
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** RULES.md (added)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - Test MIDI files scattered in root: `chord_test.mid`, `chord_test_GDAC.mid`, `chord_test_full.mid`, `chord_test_simple.mid`, `single_notes_test.mid`, `block_chords_90bpm.mid`. RULES.md says these belong in `Tests/`.
  - No `Tests/` subdirectory exists yet
- **Recommendations:**
  - Create `Tests/` directory and move all test/experimental MIDI files there
  - This would immediately improve data quality score to 7/10

---

### Agent: Ridgemont Catalog Manager
- **Folder:** `Ridgemont Catalog Manager/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 8.6/10
  - Clarity: 9/10 — SYSTEM_PROMPT_V5.md is precise, versioned (V2→V5.2), with shortcode commands and pitching protocol.
  - Scope: 8/10 — Catalog management with revenue, pitching, expenses, and deployment tracking. Broad but coherent.
  - Data Quality: 8/10 — catalog.json is well-structured. Has proper backup system. But: empty Acts/*/Songs/ directories, 4 legacy SYSTEM_PROMPT versions, .env file with potential secrets.
  - Utilization: 9/10 — Daily, core to John's music business.
  - Effectiveness: 9/10 — Phase 5C complete. Shortcode system, pitch deck generator, revenue tracking all working.
- **Files:** 62 (excluding venv, node_modules, backups)
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** None
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `Acts/FROZEN_CLOUD/Songs/`, `Acts/PARK_BELLEVUE/Songs/`, `Acts/BAJAN_SUN/Songs/` — all empty. Appears to be an abandoned directory structure.
  - `.env` file present in root — contains secrets (API tokens, database credentials). Risk if repo is shared.
  - 4 legacy SYSTEM_PROMPT versions (V2, V3, V4) still in docs/. Could confuse Claude sessions.
  - `Terminal Commands.txt` and `Sync Catalog to Streamlit.txt` — loose text files in root
- **Recommendations:**
  - Delete empty Acts/*/Songs/ directories or populate them
  - Add `.env` to `.gitignore` (verify it's already there)
  - Archive or delete legacy SYSTEM_PROMPT_V2/V3/V4.md
  - Move loose .txt files to a `docs/` or `notes/` subfolder

---

### Agent: Ridgemont Studio Website
- **Folder:** `Ridgemont Studio Website/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 5.8/10
  - Clarity: 7/10 — New RULES.md is solid with architecture docs, workflows, and security rules.
  - Scope: 8/10 — Focused on website + Cloudflare Worker streaming.
  - Data Quality: 4/10 — `tracks.json` is 0 bytes (empty). Streaming player is non-functional. `.wrangler/` state files, `index.html.zip` backup clutter.
  - Utilization: 3/10 — Occasional use.
  - Effectiveness: 5/10 — Website itself works but the core streaming feature is broken due to empty tracks.json.
- **Files:** 14
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** RULES.md (added)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - **CRITICAL:** `tracks.json` is 0 bytes — the music streaming player has no content to serve
  - `index.html.zip` — manual backup that should be handled by git
  - `.wrangler/` state directory with SQLite files — local dev state, should be in .gitignore
  - RULES.md documents this issue but it remains unresolved
- **Recommendations:**
  - **HIGH:** Populate `tracks.json` from Ridgemont Catalog Manager's catalog.json (released songs only)
  - Add `.wrangler/` to `.gitignore`
  - Remove `index.html.zip` if git history serves as backup

---

### Agent: Suno Prompt Generator
- **Folder:** `Suno Prompt Generator/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 8.6/10
  - Clarity: 9/10 — CLAUDE_INSTRUCTIONS.md has decision tree, token hierarchy, user-approved overrides.
  - Scope: 9/10 — Single, well-defined purpose. Four-engine architecture.
  - Data Quality: 9/10 — Well-organized assets/ with JSON databases. Backup system in place.
  - Utilization: 6/10 — Weekly use for prompt generation.
  - Effectiveness: 9/10 — Deterministic, reproducible output. 122 subgenres, 1228 tags.
- **Files:** 23
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** None
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `scripts/__pycache__/` — compiled Python cache in repo
  - MIGRATION_PLAN.md exists — unclear if migration is complete
- **Recommendations:**
  - Add `__pycache__/` to `.gitignore`
  - Review MIGRATION_PLAN.md — if migration is done, archive it

---

### Agent: Suno Trainer
- **Folder:** `Suno Trainer/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 5.6/10
  - Clarity: 2/10 — No rules file. A Claude session opening this folder has no instructions.
  - Scope: 8/10 — Clear reference-only purpose.
  - Data Quality: 7/10 — 3 comprehensive reference documents, well-written.
  - Utilization: 3/10 — Occasional reference lookups.
  - Effectiveness: 5/10 — Useful as a reference library but provides no automation.
- **Files:** 3
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** None
- **Issues Detected:**
  - No RULES.md — not one of the top 3 priority but still a gap
  - Strong merge candidate with Suno Prompt Generator (score: 7.5)
  - 10-Day Syllabus is a .docx file — harder for Claude to read natively than .md
- **Recommendations:**
  - **MEDIUM:** Merge into Suno Prompt Generator as a `references/` subfolder. The training docs complement the generator perfectly.
  - If kept standalone, add a RULES.md defining it as a reference library

---

### Agent: X-Posts
- **Folder:** `X-Posts/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 8.4/10
  - Clarity: 9/10 — Two complementary instruction files: CLAUDE.md (universal rules) + x_daily_post_shortcut.md (workflow). Excellent style guide with edit log.
  - Scope: 8/10 — Focused on X posting with clear boundaries. Now sole owner of all X/Twitter content.
  - Data Quality: 8/10 — Character assets organized in Weeter_and_Blubby/. Post history maintained. Scheduled posts present.
  - Utilization: 10/10 — Daily, most active agent in the ecosystem.
  - Effectiveness: 8/10 — Producing posts with character integration, uniqueness scoring, and boost review.
- **Files:** 39
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** None (but benefits from x-content consolidation)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `x_posts_feb5_remaining.md` — dated file, should be archived or deleted after use
  - 8 example_*.png files in root — could be organized into an `examples/` subfolder
- **Recommendations:**
  - Create `examples/` directory for example post images
  - Archive dated post files after their content is absorbed into x_post_history.md

---

### Agent: Ridgemont Catalog Portal (frozen-cloud-portal)
- **Folder:** `frozen-cloud-portal/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 7.4/10
  - Clarity: 8/10 — New RULES.md covers architecture, data contract, all pages, and behavior guidelines.
  - Scope: 9/10 — Single purpose: catalog browsing portal. Clean after merge.
  - Data Quality: 7/10 — Core files clean (app.py, RULES.md, data/catalog.json). But: empty `scripts/` directory, large `venv/` in repo.
  - Utilization: 4/10 — Occasional browsing tool.
  - Effectiveness: 7/10 — Functional Streamlit app supporting all 3 acts with filtering.
- **Files:** 5 (excluding venv, .git)
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** app.py (rewritten), RULES.md (added), scripts/app.py (deleted)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `scripts/` directory is empty — should be removed
  - `venv/` (10,000+ files) is in the repo — should be in .gitignore
- **Recommendations:**
  - Delete empty `scripts/` directory
  - Add `venv/` to `.gitignore` and remove from tracking

---

### Agent: park-bellevue-portal (DEPRECATED)
- **Folder:** `park-bellevue-portal/`
- **Status:** deprecated
- **Health Score:** N/A (deprecated)
- **Files:** 5 (excluding venv)
- **Notes:** Functionality absorbed into Ridgemont Catalog Portal (frozen-cloud-portal) on Feb 8, 2026. Folder retained for reference. Still has its own venv/ (10,000+ files) and backups/ directory.
- **Recommendations:**
  - **MEDIUM:** Archive entire folder to a `_deprecated/` directory or delete it entirely. Its data is available in the unified portal.

---

### Agent: Master Agent
- **Folder:** `Master Agent/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 8.2/10
  - Clarity: 8/10 — RULES.md well-defined with 6 core responsibilities.
  - Scope: 9/10 — Clear orchestrator role, well-bounded.
  - Data Quality: 9/10 — Registry v1.1 with changelog, audit template, evaluation criteria, daily monitor script.
  - Utilization: 7/10 — Used for audits and remediation.
  - Effectiveness: 8/10 — Successfully ran inaugural audit, identified 3 high-impact issues, resolved all 3.
- **Files:** 9
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** agent_registry.json (updated to v1.1), last_audit.json (updated), logs/audit_2026-02-08.md (created)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - RULES.md references `data/` paths but files are in root (agent_registry.json, not data/agent_registry.json)
  - daily_monitor.py automation not yet configured (needs API key + LaunchAgent setup)
- **Recommendations:**
  - Align RULES.md file paths to match actual file locations (files are in root, not data/)
  - Set up daily_monitor.py automation when ready

## Cross-Agent Analysis

### Overlap Detection
1. **Suno Prompt Generator ↔ Suno Trainer** (score: 7.5) — Trainer's reference docs directly complement the Generator's workflow. Same domain, same user need. Medium-priority merge candidate.
2. **Frozen Cloud Website ↔ Ridgemont Studio Website** — Both are static web properties for the same music label. Different audiences (artist page vs. label platform) but could share deployment workflows.
3. **Make Videos X_Content residue ↔ X-Posts** — The x-content skill was deleted but generated content files remain in Make Videos. These are orphaned and should be cleaned up.

### Gap Detection
1. **No Bajan Sun dedicated presence** — Frozen Cloud has its own website agent, Park Bellevue had its own portal (now merged). Bajan Sun has no dedicated web presence beyond a row in the catalog portal.
2. **No distribution automation** — Deployment tracking exists (portal) but no agent handles the actual DistroKid/TuneCore upload workflow.
3. **No social media analytics agent** — X-Posts generates content but nothing tracks performance metrics, follower growth, or engagement trends over time.
4. **No copyright/registration agent** — Catalog Manager tracks copyright numbers but no agent manages the copyright registration workflow (Copyright.gov, PRO registration).

### Merge Candidates
| Agents | Score | Priority | Rationale |
|--------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Suno Prompt Generator + Suno Trainer | 7.5 | Medium | Same domain, complementary content. Trainer docs become references/ subfolder. |
| Frozen Cloud Website + Ridgemont Studio Website | 5.8 | Low | Related domain but different purposes. Keep separate unless website management becomes a single workflow. |

### Split Candidates
| Agent | Score | Priority | Rationale |
|-------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Make Videos | 7.0 | Low (↓ from Medium) | After x-content removal, scope is more focused. YouTube daily show + Shorts + recording aids are related workflows. Split no longer urgent. |

---

## Priority Recommendations

1. **HIGH:** Clean up residual X_Content files in Make Videos — orphaned data from deleted skill (`YT_Content_Review/X_Content/2026-02-05/`)
2. **HIGH:** Populate `tracks.json` in Ridgemont Studio Website from Ridgemont Catalog Manager — the streaming player is non-functional without it
3. **MEDIUM:** Merge Suno Trainer into Suno Prompt Generator as a `references/` subfolder (merge score: 7.5)
4. **MEDIUM:** Archive or delete `park-bellevue-portal/` folder — it's deprecated and consumes 10,000+ files via its venv
5. **MEDIUM:** Organize Make-Music test MIDI files into `Tests/` subfolder per RULES.md conventions
6. **LOW:** Clean up Ridgemont Catalog Manager: delete empty Acts/Songs dirs, archive legacy SYSTEM_PROMPT versions, move loose .txt files
7. **LOW:** Add venv/ and __pycache__/ to .gitignore across all agents with Python environments
8. **LOW:** Fix Master Agent RULES.md file paths to match actual locations
