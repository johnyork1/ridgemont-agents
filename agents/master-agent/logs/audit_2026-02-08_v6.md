**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Generated by:** Master Agent — Orchestrator
**Previous Audit:** v5 (2026-02-08, routine reaudit)

## Executive Summary
Ecosystem cleanup complete. Two deprecated folders (_deprecated-park-bellevue-portal, Suno Trainer) deleted and Suno Prompt Generator renamed to Suno Studio, reducing the ecosystem from 13 folders to 11 active agent folders with zero deprecated dead weight. Ecosystem score holds at 7.4/10 with Suno Studio's consolidation bump (8.6→8.8) offset by persistent Ridgemont Studio Website staleness (4 audit cycles unfixed). Five action items remain, all carried forward.

## Overall Ecosystem Score: 7.4/10

## Cross-Agent Analysis

### Overlap Detection
1. **Frozen Cloud Website ↔ Ridgemont Studio Website**: Both serve web content for the same label. Frozen Cloud is a static artist page; Ridgemont Studio is the full platform. Merge score: 5.8 (caution zone — keep monitoring).
2. **Make-Music ↔ Suno Studio**: Complementary, not overlapping. Make-Music handles songwriting/MIDI; Suno Studio handles AI prompt generation. Clean boundary via RULES.md cross-references.

### Gap Detection
1. **Social media analytics**: X-Posts generates content but no agent tracks engagement metrics, follower growth, or post performance.
2. **Revenue/royalty tracking automation**: Ridgemont Catalog Manager has the data model but no automated import from distributors.
3. **Website deployment CI/CD**: Manual git push workflow for both websites — no automation agent.

### Merge Candidates
| Pair | Data Overlap | Rules Overlap | Workflow Overlap | Domain Proximity | Complexity Impact | Weighted Score |
|------|-------------|---------------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Frozen Cloud Website + Ridgemont Studio Website | 3/10 | 2/10 | 3/10 | 8/10 | 9/10 | 5.8 |

**Verdict:** Below merge threshold (7.0). Keep separate but revisit if Frozen Cloud Website remains unused.

### Split Candidates
None — all agents are appropriately scoped.

## Priority Recommendations

1. **HIGH:** Fix Ridgemont Studio Website RULES.md — 3 stale "tracks.json is empty" references on lines 20, 61, 74. This has persisted for **4 consecutive audit cycles** (v2→v3→v4→v5→v6). tracks.json has contained 6 tracks since the v1.2 fix cycle.
2. **HIGH:** Install CourtListener MCP for dewey-cheatem-esq — agent has been structurally ready since onboarding but has never produced output due to missing MCP connectivity.
3. **MEDIUM:** Delete ~$ Word temp lock file from dr-vinnie-boombatz root.
4. **MEDIUM:** Add .gitignore to Make Videos root to exclude node_modules/ (~9K files).
5. **LOW:** Organize X-Posts example PNGs (8 files) into an examples/ subfolder.

---

## Action Items
- [ ] Fix Ridgemont Studio Website RULES.md lines 20, 61, 74 — replace "empty/needs population" with current state (6 tracks populated)
- [ ] Install CourtListener MCP server for dewey-cheatem-esq and run first test query
- [ ] Delete ~$_Vinnie_Boombatz_Supplement_Protocol_Q1_2026.docx temp file
- [ ] Add .gitignore to Make Videos root (exclude node_modules/, .DS_Store)
- [ ] Move X-Posts example_*.png and post_*.png files into examples/ subfolder
