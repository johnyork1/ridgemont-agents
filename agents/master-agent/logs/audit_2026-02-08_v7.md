# Daily Agent Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Generated by:** Master Agent — Orchestrator
**Audit Version:** v7
**Previous Audit:** v6.2 (post-remediation, same day)

---

## Executive Summary
Ecosystem continues to mature. The standout change is dewey-cheatem-esq producing its first major real-world output — 10 estate planning documents for the Dixon family — validating the agent's design and jumping its utilization score. A new `documents/` directory appeared organically. One new ~$ temp lock file and lingering Ridgemont Studio Website cleanup items remain as action items.

## Overall Ecosystem Score: 8.0/10
*(Up from 7.9 in v6.2 — driven by dewey-cheatem-esq utilization surge)*
