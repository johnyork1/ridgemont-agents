# Daily Agent Audit Report
**Date:** 2026-02-08
**Generated by:** Master Agent — Orchestrator
**Version:** v4 (post-onboarding re-audit)

## Executive Summary

The Ridgemont Studio agent ecosystem now comprises **11 active agents** and **2 deprecated agents** (13 total folders). Two brand-new agents — **dewey-cheatem-esq** (legal research) and **dr-vinnie-boombatz** (medical AI) — were discovered and onboarded this cycle. Dr. Vinnie Boombatz is the most structurally sophisticated agent in the entire ecosystem with 23 files across 10 skills, 8 slash commands, and a research sub-agent. The ecosystem score dips slightly to **7.3/10** from 7.8 due to the new agents' zero utilization, but structural health is at an all-time high.

## Overall Ecosystem Score: 7.3/10

## Agent-by-Agent Status

### Agent: dewey-cheatem-esq ⭐ NEW
- **Folder:** `dewey-cheatem-esq/`
- **Status:** new
- **Health Score:** 6.4/10
  - Clarity: 9/10 — Excellent CLAUDE.md with IRAC methodology, jurisdiction hierarchy, source priority, client context, and mandatory disclaimers.
  - Scope: 9/10 — Tightly focused on legal research across 3 jurisdictions (Federal, California, Idaho).
  - Data Quality: 8/10 — Well-organized: CLAUDE.md, CONNECTORS.md, free-legal-sources.md, plugin.json, .mcp.json. No stale data.
  - Utilization: 1/10 — Brand new, zero usage.
  - Effectiveness: 5/10 — Untested in practice; architecturally sound.
- **Files:** 6 (CLAUDE.md, CONNECTORS.md, free-legal-sources.md, plugin.json, .mcp.json, README.md)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - CourtListener MCP server not yet installed (requires free API token + git clone)
  - Google Scholar MCP path is placeholder (`/Users/johnyork/mcp-servers/google-scholar-mcp/main.py` — doesn't exist yet)
  - Output directories referenced in CLAUDE.md (`research/`, `contracts/`, `briefs/`, `citations/`) don't exist
  - No RULES.md — uses CLAUDE.md convention (acceptable for plugin format)
- **Recommendations:**
  - Register for CourtListener API token and install MCP server
  - Create output directories: `research/`, `contracts/`, `briefs/`, `citations/`
  - Run first test query to validate end-to-end pipeline

### Agent: dr-vinnie-boombatz ⭐ NEW
- **Folder:** `dr-vinnie-boombatz/`
- **Status:** new
- **Health Score:** 6.8/10
  - Clarity: 10/10 — Best-documented agent in the ecosystem. CLAUDE.md covers persona, 5 core principles, behavioral guidelines, tool priority, output standards, disclaimer template. README.md documents full plugin structure.
  - Scope: 9/10 — Focused medical domain with 10 specialty skills clearly separated.
  - Data Quality: 9/10 — 23 files in clean hierarchy: agents/, commands/, skills/, plus manifest files.
  - Utilization: 1/10 — Brand new, zero usage.
  - Effectiveness: 5/10 — Untested; but architecturally the most complete agent plugin by far.
- **Files:** 23 (.claude-plugin/plugin.json, .mcp.json, CLAUDE.md, README.md, 1 sub-agent, 8 commands, 10 skills)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `.mcp.json` references `pubmed.mcp.claude.com/mcp` — this may be a placeholder URL; PubMed tools are available natively in Cowork
  - Google Scholar MCP not configured
  - No actual research output files yet (no reports generated)
- **Recommendations:**
  - Validate PubMed connectivity through Cowork's built-in PubMed MCP tools
  - Run first test query (e.g., `/dr-vinnie-boombatz:research-review GLP-1 agonists`) to validate pipeline
  - Consider adding a `reports/` output directory

  - Effectiveness: 7/10
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** 11 test MIDIs moved to Tests/
- **Issues Detected:**
  - `Getting_Old_73bpm.mid` is in root — should it be in Tests/ or is it a final? (Naming suggests final)
  - `Trouble Bad/` contains a Logic Pro project (binary `.musicapps-project-folder`) — this is fine
- **Recommendations:** Clarify naming convention: production MIDIs in root, tests in Tests/

### Agent: Ridgemont Studio Website
- **Folder:** `Ridgemont Studio Website/`
- **Status:** active
- **Health Score:** 6.2/10
  - Clarity: 7/10
  - Scope: 8/10
  - Data Quality: 6/10
  - Utilization: 3/10
  - Effectiveness: 6/10
- **Files Changed Since Last Audit:** tracks.json populated (6 tracks, 1048 bytes), .gitignore added
- **Issues Detected:**
  - **STALE RULES.md**: Lines 20, 61, 73-74 still say tracks.json is "currently empty" and "NEEDS POPULATION" — this was fixed earlier today
  - `index.html.zip` backup file — should be in a `backups/` folder or deleted
  - `test-track.mp3` — test file in production folder
- **Recommendations:**
  - Update RULES.md to reflect tracks.json is now populated

- **Recommendations:** Create RULES.md or merge with Ridgemont Studio Website

### Agent: Suno Trainer (DEPRECATED)
- **Folder:** `Suno Trainer/`
- **Status:** merged → Suno Prompt Generator
- **Health Score:** n/a
- **Files:** 4 (DEPRECATED.md + 3 original files that were copied to Suno Prompt Generator/references/training/)
- **Issues Detected:**
  - Original files still present alongside DEPRECATED.md — can be deleted at John's discretion
- **Recommendations:** Delete folder contents except DEPRECATED.md, or delete entire folder

### Agent: _deprecated-park-bellevue-portal (DEPRECATED)
- **Folder:** `_deprecated-park-bellevue-portal/`
- **Status:** deprecated (merged into frozen-cloud-portal)
- **Health Score:** n/a

## New Agents Discovered

### dewey-cheatem-esq — "Dewey Cheatem, Esq."
**Purpose:** Legal research and advisory agent covering U.S. Federal, California, and Idaho law.
**Architecture:** Plugin format (CLAUDE.md + plugin.json + .mcp.json). No skills/ or commands/ subdirectories — research methodology is inline in CLAUDE.md.
**Related Agents:** None directly — this is a new domain for the ecosystem.
**Overlap Concerns:** None. Legal research is entirely distinct from existing music/content agents.
**Onboarding Status:** Structurally complete. Needs CourtListener MCP installation and first test run.

### dr-vinnie-boombatz — "Dr. Vinnie Boombatz"
**Purpose:** Medical AI agent providing evidence-based medical information, research synthesis, and AI-in-medicine expertise.
**Architecture:** Full plugin format with `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.mcp.json`, CLAUDE.md, README.md, 1 sub-agent (`agents/medical-researcher.md`), 8 slash commands, and 10 specialized skills covering clinical diagnosis, pharmacology, medical research, AI advances, patient education, emergency medicine, lab interpretation, medical imaging, preventive medicine, and mental health.
**Related Agents:** None directly — new domain.
**Overlap Concerns:** None. Medical domain is entirely distinct.
**Onboarding Status:** Structurally the most complete agent in the ecosystem. Needs PubMed connectivity validation and first test run.

## Cross-Agent Analysis

### Overlap Detection
1. **Frozen Cloud Website ↔ Ridgemont Studio Website**: Both serve as web presences for Ridgemont acts. Low overlap but merge candidate.
2. **Make-Music ↔ Suno Prompt Generator**: Complementary, not overlapping. Make-Music defers to Suno Prompt Generator for production-grade prompts. Clear boundaries.
3. **dewey-cheatem-esq ↔ dr-vinnie-boombatz**: Zero overlap. Different domains entirely.

### Gap Detection
1. **No financial/business agent**: John manages Ridgemont Studio as a business but has no dedicated accounting, tax, or business operations agent.
2. **No project management agent**: Cross-agent coordination is manual. Could benefit from a task/project tracker agent.
3. **No social media analytics agent**: X-Posts creates content but doesn't analyze performance metrics systematically.

### Merge Candidates
| Pair | Score | Priority | Rationale |
|------|-------|----------|-----------|
| Frozen Cloud Website + Ridgemont Studio Website | 5.8 | Low | Both are web properties but serve different acts/purposes. Consider only if Frozen Cloud site will be retired. |

### Split Candidates
None. All agents are appropriately scoped.

---

## Priority Recommendations
1. **HIGH:** Run first test queries on both new agents (dewey-cheatem-esq and dr-vinnie-boombatz) to validate their pipelines and establish baseline effectiveness scores.
2. **HIGH:** Update Ridgemont Studio Website RULES.md — stale text claims tracks.json is empty when it's been populated.
3. **MEDIUM:** Install CourtListener MCP server for dewey-cheatem-esq (free API token required).
4. **MEDIUM:** Add `.gitignore` to Make Videos root (exclude `node_modules/`).
5. **MEDIUM:** Create output directories for dewey-cheatem-esq (`research/`, `contracts/`, `briefs/`, `citations/`).
6. **LOW:** Consider deleting Suno Trainer folder entirely (content is preserved in Suno Prompt Generator).
7. **LOW:** Consider deleting `_deprecated-park-bellevue-portal` folder entirely.
8. **LOW:** Delete or relocate `frozen-cloud-portal/venv/` — recreatable from requirements.txt.
