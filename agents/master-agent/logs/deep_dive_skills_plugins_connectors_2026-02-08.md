## Recommendations by Agent

### 1. X-Posts — @4_Bchainbasics
**Current gaps:** Real-time crypto data for posts, social analytics for boost decisions

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **LunarCrush** | MCP Connector | Real-time crypto social sentiment, trending topics, creator analytics. Replaces manual web searches for trending crypto X posts. Directly feeds Step 4 (Pull Top 5 Trending). | **HIGH** |
| **Crypto.com Market Data** | MCP Connector | Real-time prices, candlesticks, tickers. Provides the "specific numbers" the workflow demands (prices, liquidation data) without web scraping. | **HIGH** |
| **Ahrefs** | MCP Connector | Track @4_Bchainbasics SEO/social visibility over time. Brand radar for AI search mentions. Useful for content strategy beyond X. | LOW |

**Estimated impact:** LunarCrush + Crypto.com together would eliminate ~30% of the manual research time in the daily workflow and improve data accuracy.

---

### 2. Make Videos — Blockchain Basics YouTube
**Current gaps:** No direct platform APIs, relies entirely on Claude in Chrome for uploads

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Cloudinary** | MCP Connector | Video/image asset management, transformation, and delivery. Could handle thumbnail generation, video clip formatting for different platforms (9:16 shorts vs 16:9 main). | MEDIUM |
| **LunarCrush** | MCP Connector | Same as X-Posts — crypto social sentiment feeds the daily research phase for video scripts. | **HIGH** |
| **Crypto.com Market Data** | MCP Connector | Same as X-Posts — real-time market data for script accuracy. | **HIGH** |
| **`/shorts` skill** | Custom Skill | GAME_PLAN.md lists this as a TODO. Build a skill that generates short-form video scripts from the daily main script. | **HIGH** |
| **`/yt-daily` skill** | Custom Skill | Also listed as TODO. Full daily workflow automation (research → script → notes). | **HIGH** |

**Estimated impact:** The two custom skills are the biggest wins here — they're already spec'd out in GAME_PLAN.md but never built. LunarCrush/Crypto.com shared with X-Posts would serve both agents.

---

### 3. Dewey Cheatem, Esq. — Legal Research
**Current gaps:** CourtListener REST API works but is manual (curl/WebFetch). No direct statute database API.

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **docx skill** | Cowork Skill | Already available in Cowork. Should be referenced in CLAUDE.md since Dewey produces .docx files (wills, POAs, compliance audits). Currently generating docs without the skill's best practices. | **HIGH** |
| **pdf skill** | Cowork Skill | Already available in Cowork. Useful for producing final client-ready PDFs of legal documents, or reading uploaded legal PDFs. | MEDIUM |
| **CourtListener as native skill** | Custom Skill | Wrap the REST API calls (auth header, endpoints) into a proper `/courtlistener` skill with structured commands (`/search-opinions`, `/verify-citation`, `/lookup-docket`). Removes the need to remember API syntax. | MEDIUM |

**Note:** The MCP registry has no dedicated legal/court connectors. CourtListener REST API is the best available option and it's already configured.

---

### 4. Dr. Vinnie Boombatz — Medical AI
**Current gaps:** Low utilization. Rich infrastructure but limited connector coverage beyond PubMed.

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Clinical Trials** | MCP Connector | ClinicalTrials.gov data — search trials, eligibility, endpoints, sponsors. Already noted as a "recommended addition" in .mcp.json. Now available in the registry. | **HIGH** |
| **ChEMBL** | MCP Connector | Drug database — ADMET data, bioactivity, mechanisms, target search. Fills the pharmacology gap. | **HIGH** |
| **ICD-10 Codes** | MCP Connector | Diagnosis and procedure code lookup. Useful for interpreting medical records and coding. | MEDIUM |
| **bioRxiv** | MCP Connector | Pre-print access for cutting-edge biomedical research not yet in PubMed. | MEDIUM |
| **Function Health** | MCP Connector | Lab test insights, biomarker analysis, health action plans. Would directly support the lab interpretation workflow. | MEDIUM |
| **HealthEx** | MCP Connector | Connect personal health records for personalized insights. Useful if John wants to analyze his own labs. | LOW (privacy considerations) |
| **docx skill** | Cowork Skill | Same as Dewey — the supplement protocol was a .docx. Use the skill for higher quality medical reports. | MEDIUM |

**Estimated impact:** Clinical Trials + ChEMBL would transform Dr. Vinnie from "PubMed-only" to a genuine multi-source medical research agent. These are the connectors that will drive utilization up.

---

### 5. Ridgemont Catalog Manager — Music Catalog Hub
**Current gaps:** No direct integration with distribution platforms or streaming services

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **xlsx skill** | Cowork Skill | Already available. The catalog has Artists.xlsx and JSON data files. Use for structured data analysis, financial reporting, and catalog exports. | MEDIUM |
| **Catalog sync skill** | Custom Skill | Build a `/catalog-sync` skill that pushes updated catalog.json to frozen-cloud-portal/data/ and generates tracks.json for Ridgemont Studio Website. Currently a manual process. | MEDIUM |

**Note:** No DistroKid, Songtradr, or streaming platform connectors exist in the MCP registry. These would be the holy grail but aren't available yet.

---

### 6. Ridgemont Studio Website — Label Site
**Current gaps:** Deployment is manual (git push + wrangler deploy)

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Cloudflare Developer Platform** | MCP Connector | Direct management of Workers, KV namespaces, R2 storage. Could deploy worker.js updates and manage the music storage bucket without CLI. | **HIGH** |

**Estimated impact:** This is the most impactful single connector for this agent — it would enable automated deployments and R2 storage management directly from Cowork.

---

### 7. Frozen Cloud Website — Static Landing Page
**Current gaps:** No RULES.md, no agent instructions, minimal standalone value

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| No connectors recommended | — | This agent has too little scope to justify additional tooling. Continue monitoring as a merge candidate with Ridgemont Studio Website. | — |

---

### 8. Make-Music — Songwriting & MIDI
**Current gaps:** Isolated workflow, no external integrations

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Play Sheet Music** | MCP Connector | Already connected but unused. Could preview compositions as sheet music + audio directly from ABC notation before generating MIDI. | LOW |
| **Suno API skill** | Custom Skill | If/when Suno releases an API, build a skill to submit prompts directly. Currently Suno prompts are copy/pasted manually. | FUTURE |

---

### 9. Suno Studio — Prompt Generator
**Current gaps:** Self-contained, no external data needs

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Melon** | MCP Connector | Korean music chart data. Could inspire genre/style ideas, but limited practical value for prompt generation. | LOW |
| No urgent needs | — | This agent is extremely well-built (scope 10/10). The 4-engine architecture and 1200+ tag database is self-sufficient. | — |

---

### 10. Ridgemont Catalog Portal — Streamlit Browser
**Current gaps:** Read-only portal with no external integrations needed

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| No connectors recommended | — | This is a local viewing tool. Its data comes from Ridgemont Catalog Manager. No external integrations needed. | — |

---

### 11. Master Agent — Orchestrator
**Current gaps:** No automated monitoring, audit is manual

| Recommendation | Type | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|------|--------|----------|
| **Scheduled audit shortcut** | Cowork Shortcut | Create a daily scheduled shortcut that runs the audit automatically and emails John a summary. Uses existing Gmail + Google Calendar connectors. | **HIGH** |
| **`/audit` skill** | Custom Skill | Formalize the audit workflow into a repeatable skill with standardized output. Currently relies on RULES.md + template + evaluation criteria being read each time. | MEDIUM |
