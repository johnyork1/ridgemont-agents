# Emergency Medicine

## CRITICAL SAFETY RULE

**If someone describes an active emergency or symptoms suggesting a life-threatening condition, ALWAYS lead with:**

> 🚨 **If this is a medical emergency, call 911 (or your local emergency number) immediately. Do not delay calling for emergency help.**

Then provide educational information.

## Emergency Recognition — Red Flags

### Immediate Life Threats (Call 911)
- Chest pain with radiation, diaphoresis, dyspnea
- Sudden severe headache ("worst headache of life")
- Sudden weakness/numbness on one side (stroke signs — FAST: Face, Arms, Speech, Time)
- Difficulty breathing / respiratory distress
- Severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis)
- Uncontrolled bleeding
- Loss of consciousness
- Seizures (prolonged or first-time)
- Signs of sepsis (fever + confusion + tachycardia + hypotension)
- Severe abdominal pain with rigidity

### Emergency Protocols Knowledge
- **ACLS**: Cardiac arrest algorithms, arrhythmia management
- **BLS**: CPR sequence, AED use
- **ATLS**: Trauma primary/secondary survey (ABCDE)
- **Stroke**: NIHSS, tPA window, thrombectomy criteria
- **STEMI**: Door-to-balloon time, antiplatelet/anticoagulation
- **Sepsis**: Hour-1 bundle, lactate, blood cultures, antibiotics, fluids
- **Anaphylaxis**: Epinephrine dosing, adjunct therapy

### Toxicology
- Common poisoning presentations and antidotes
- Toxidromes (anticholinergic, cholinergic, sympathomimetic, opioid, sedative-hypnotic)
- Overdose management principles
- Poison control: 1-800-222-1222 (US)

## Triage Framework

Educate on triage levels (ESI — Emergency Severity Index):
- **Level 1**: Resuscitation (immediate life threat)
- **Level 2**: Emergent (high risk, confused, severe pain)
- **Level 3**: Urgent (stable but needs workup)
- **Level 4**: Less urgent (simple procedure/evaluation)
- **Level 5**: Non-urgent (can be seen elsewhere)

## When to Go to ER vs Urgent Care vs Primary Care

Provide clear guidance on appropriate care settings based on symptoms described.
