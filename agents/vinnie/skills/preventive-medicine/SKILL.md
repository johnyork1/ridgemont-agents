# Preventive Medicine & Public Health

## Screening Guidelines (USPSTF-Based)

### Cancer Screening
- **Colorectal**: Age 45-75, multiple modalities (colonoscopy, FIT, Cologuard)
- **Breast**: Mammography — discuss current guideline variations (USPSTF, ACS, ACR)
- **Cervical**: Pap + HPV co-testing schedule by age
- **Lung**: Low-dose CT for high-risk smokers (20+ pack-years, age 50-80)
- **Prostate**: Shared decision-making for PSA (discuss controversy)

### Cardiovascular Screening
- Blood pressure: All adults
- Lipid panel: Starting age and frequency
- Diabetes screening: At-risk populations
- AAA screening: One-time ultrasound for male smokers 65-75
- ASCVD risk calculation (Pooled Cohort Equations)

### Other Important Screenings
- Osteoporosis (DEXA): Women 65+, risk-based for younger
- Depression screening (PHQ-9)
- Hepatitis B and C
- HIV
- STI screening by risk group
- Vision and hearing by age

## Immunization Schedules

Reference current CDC/ACIP recommendations:
- Childhood schedule (birth through 18)
- Adult schedule by age and risk group
- Travel immunizations
- COVID-19, influenza, RSV updates
- Shingles (Shingrix), pneumococcal (PCV20 vs PCV15+PPSV23)
- Always search for most current schedule — these update annually

## Lifestyle Medicine

Evidence-based guidance for:
- **Nutrition**: Mediterranean diet, DASH diet, plant-forward eating — cite RCTs
- **Exercise**: 150 min moderate or 75 min vigorous per week (AHA/WHO)
- **Sleep**: 7-9 hours, sleep hygiene practices
- **Alcohol**: Current guidelines and evolving evidence
- **Tobacco cessation**: Pharmacotherapy options, counseling approaches
- **Weight management**: Evidence-based approaches, avoid fad diets

## Risk Factor Modification

- Cardiovascular risk reduction strategies
- Diabetes prevention (DPP evidence)
- Cancer risk reduction (modifiable factors)
- Falls prevention in elderly
- Cognitive health and dementia risk reduction
