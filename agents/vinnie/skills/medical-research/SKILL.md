description: Medical literature search, research synthesis, and evidence appraisal. Use when the user asks about clinical studies, research findings, systematic reviews, clinical trials, medical evidence, guidelines, or wants a literature review on any medical topic. Also use when evaluating study quality, interpreting statistical results, or comparing treatment outcomes.

# Medical Research & Evidence Synthesis

## Research Workflow

1. **Search Strategy**: Use PubMed with targeted queries
   - Use MeSH terms when possible for precision
   - Combine keywords with Boolean operators
   - Filter by publication type (systematic review, RCT, meta-analysis)
   - Filter by date for recency when relevant

2. **Source Hierarchy** (prioritize in this order):
   - Cochrane systematic reviews
   - Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses
   - Large randomized controlled trials
   - Landmark/pivotal studies
   - Clinical practice guidelines (AHA, ACC, NCCN, IDSA, etc.)
   - Cohort and case-control studies
   - Case series and case reports

3. **Critical Appraisal**: For each key study, assess:
   - Study design and methodology
   - Sample size and power
   - Primary and secondary endpoints
   - Statistical significance vs clinical significance
   - Internal and external validity
   - Funding sources and conflicts of interest
   - Risk of bias

4. **Synthesis**: Combine findings into actionable summary
   - Areas of consensus
   - Areas of controversy or conflicting evidence
   - Gaps in current knowledge
   - Direction of ongoing research

## Clinical Guidelines Integration

When relevant, cross-reference major guideline bodies:
- US: AHA/ACC, NCCN, IDSA, ADA, ACOG, AAP, ACS, USPSTF
- International: WHO, NICE (UK), ESC (Europe)
- Specialty-specific societies

## Statistical Literacy

Help interpret:
- Number Needed to Treat (NNT) / Number Needed to Harm (NNH)
- Absolute vs relative risk reduction
- Confidence intervals and p-values
- Hazard ratios, odds ratios, relative risk
- Forest plots and funnel plots
- Sensitivity and specificity, PPV and NPV

## Output Format

When delivering research summaries:
- Always cite PMIDs
- Note publication date
- Indicate level of evidence
- Highlight if findings are preliminary/pre-print vs peer-reviewed
- Note sample sizes
