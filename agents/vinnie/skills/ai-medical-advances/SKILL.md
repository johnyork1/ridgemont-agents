# AI in Medicine — Advances & Applications

## Core Domains of AI in Medicine

### 1. Diagnostic Imaging AI
- **Radiology**: AI for X-ray, CT, MRI interpretation (lung nodule detection, fracture detection, stroke detection)
- **Pathology**: Digital pathology, whole-slide image analysis, cancer grading
- **Ophthalmology**: Diabetic retinopathy screening (IDx-DR — first FDA-approved autonomous AI diagnostic)
- **Dermatology**: Skin lesion classification, melanoma detection
- **Cardiology**: Echo interpretation, ECG AI (atrial fibrillation detection from sinus rhythm)
- Always note: FDA clearance status (510(k), De Novo, PMA) and clinical validation level

### 2. Drug Discovery & Development
- **AlphaFold / protein structure**: Impact on target identification
- **Generative AI for molecules**: De novo drug design
- **Clinical trial optimization**: AI for patient selection, trial design, endpoint prediction
- **Repurposing**: AI identification of existing drugs for new indications
- **Key companies/platforms**: Insilico Medicine, Recursion, Isomorphic Labs, BenevolentAI

### 3. Genomics & Precision Medicine
- AI for variant interpretation (ACMG classification assistance)
- Polygenic risk scores
- Pharmacogenomics — AI-guided drug selection
- Liquid biopsy and ctDNA analysis
- Multi-omics integration (genomics + proteomics + metabolomics)

### 4. Clinical Decision Support
- Sepsis prediction models (e.g., Epic Sepsis Model — discuss limitations)
- Clinical deterioration early warning
- Risk stratification models
- Treatment recommendation engines
- EHR-integrated AI tools

### 5. Natural Language Processing in Healthcare
- Clinical note summarization
- Medical coding automation (ICD, CPT)
- Literature mining and evidence synthesis
- Patient communication (chatbots, triage)
- Ambient clinical documentation (DAX Copilot, Abridge, Nabla)

### 6. Surgical & Robotic AI
- Robotic-assisted surgery (da Vinci, Medtronic Hugo)
- Surgical planning AI
- Intraoperative guidance
- Autonomous surgical robots (research stage)

### 7. Wearables & Remote Monitoring
- Continuous glucose monitors + AI
- ECG wearables (Apple Watch AFib detection)
- Sleep analysis
- Digital biomarkers
- RPM platforms with AI analytics

### 8. Foundation Models in Medicine
- Med-PaLM, Med-Gemini, BioMedLM, PMC-LLaMA
- GPT-4 medical performance benchmarks
- Multimodal medical AI (text + imaging + labs)
- Fine-tuning vs prompting for clinical tasks

## Evaluation Framework

When discussing any AI medical technology:
1. **Regulatory status**: FDA cleared/approved? CE marked? Research-only?
2. **Clinical validation**: Prospective trials? Retrospective only? External validation?
3. **Real-world performance**: Does it match trial results in deployment?
4. **Bias & equity**: Training data diversity? Performance across demographics?
5. **Integration**: How does it fit into clinical workflow?
6. **Limitations**: False positive/negative rates, edge cases, failure modes

## Staying Current

Always search for the latest developments. This field moves weekly:
- Use web search for: "AI FDA approval medicine [current year]", "medical AI clinical trial results"
- Use PubMed for: peer-reviewed validation studies
- Track key conferences: RSNA, MICCAI, NeurIPS (health track), AMIA, HIMSS
