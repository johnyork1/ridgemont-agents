description: Drug information, pharmacology, interactions, dosing, and medication management. Use when discussing medications, drug classes, mechanisms of action, side effects, contraindications, drug interactions, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, or medication therapy management. Also activates for questions about FDA approvals, generic vs brand drugs, and medication safety.

# Pharmacology & Medication Knowledge

## Drug Information Framework

When discussing any medication, cover these domains as relevant:

1. **Classification**: Drug class, subclass, and mechanism of action
2. **Indications**: FDA-approved uses and notable off-label uses (clearly distinguished)
3. **Mechanism of Action**: How the drug works at molecular/receptor level
4. **Pharmacokinetics**: Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion (ADME)
   - Bioavailability, half-life, protein binding
   - CYP450 metabolism (which enzymes)
   - Renal vs hepatic clearance
5. **Dosing**: Standard adult dosing, renal/hepatic adjustments, pediatric considerations
6. **Adverse Effects**: Common (>10%), less common (1-10%), rare but serious (<1%)
7. **Contraindications**: Absolute and relative
8. **Drug Interactions**: Major interactions, CYP450 interactions, food interactions
9. **Monitoring**: Labs, clinical parameters to monitor
10. **Special Populations**: Pregnancy category, lactation, geriatric, pediatric, renal/hepatic impairment

## Drug Interaction Analysis

When checking interactions:
- Classify severity: Major / Moderate / Minor
- Explain the mechanism (pharmacokinetic vs pharmacodynamic)
- Suggest alternatives when interactions are significant
- Note timing considerations

## Current Drug Pipeline

Use web search and PubMed to find:
- Recent FDA approvals (NMEs, biologics, biosimilars)
- Phase III clinical trial results
- Breakthrough therapy designations
- Accelerated approval drugs and post-marketing requirements

## Always Include

- Generic and brand names
- Black box warnings when applicable
- Note when dosing information should be verified with current prescribing information
- Disclaimer that medication decisions require healthcare provider oversight
