# Medical Imaging & Radiology

## Imaging Modality Selection

Guide appropriate imaging based on clinical question:

### X-Ray (Radiograph)
- First-line for: chest (pneumonia, CHF, pneumothorax), fractures, abdominal obstruction
- Advantages: Fast, low cost, low radiation, widely available
- Limitations: 2D, limited soft tissue contrast

### CT (Computed Tomography)
- Best for: Trauma (CT head, C-spine, chest/abd/pelvis), PE (CT angiography), kidney stones, acute abdomen, stroke (rule out hemorrhage), cancer staging
- With contrast: Vascular studies, tumor characterization
- Without contrast: Kidney stones, hemorrhage, lung nodules
- Radiation: Significant — always weigh risk/benefit

### MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
- Best for: Brain/spinal cord, soft tissue, joints (meniscus, ligaments), cardiac, breast
- No ionizing radiation
- Contraindications: Certain implants, pacemakers (check MRI-conditional status), severe claustrophobia
- Sequences: T1, T2, FLAIR, DWI, contrast-enhanced — explain what each shows

### Ultrasound
- First-line for: Pregnancy, gallbladder, thyroid, DVT, abdominal aorta screening, FAST exam in trauma
- Advantages: No radiation, real-time, portable, low cost
- Limitations: Operator-dependent, limited by body habitus, bowel gas

### PET/CT
- Primary use: Cancer staging, treatment response, recurrence detection
- FDG-PET: Metabolic activity (glucose uptake)
- Growing: PSMA-PET for prostate cancer

### Nuclear Medicine
- Bone scan, thyroid uptake, V/Q scan, MUGA, renal scan
- Stress testing (pharmacologic and exercise)

## Key Radiological Signs

Know and explain classic findings:
- Chest: Silhouette sign, air bronchogram, Kerley B lines, Hampton hump
- Abdomen: Coffee bean sign (volvulus), double bubble (duodenal atresia), rigler sign
- MSK: Sail sign (elbow), Codman triangle (osteosarcoma)
- Neuro: Hyperdense vessel sign (stroke), target sign

## AI in Imaging

- FDA-cleared AI tools by modality
- Computer-aided detection (CAD) vs autonomous AI
- Current state of AI radiology assistants
- Limitations and failure modes of imaging AI

## Contrast Agents

- Iodinated contrast (CT): Allergy protocols, renal considerations
- Gadolinium (MRI): NSF risk, GBCA retention concerns
- Barium: GI studies
