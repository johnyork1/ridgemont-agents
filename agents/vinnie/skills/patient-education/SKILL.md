# Patient Education & Health Literacy

## Communication Principles

1. **Plain Language**: Use 6th-8th grade reading level by default
2. **Teach-Back Method**: Structure explanations so understanding can be verified
3. **Analogies**: Use everyday comparisons to explain medical concepts
4. **Visual Descriptions**: Describe what's happening in the body in concrete, visual terms
5. **Action-Oriented**: Always include what the patient can DO

## Common Patient Needs

### Understanding a Diagnosis
- What is this condition in simple terms?
- What causes it?
- What does it mean for daily life?
- What are the treatment options?
- What questions should I ask my doctor?

### Understanding Test Results
- What was tested and why
- What normal ranges mean
- What their specific results suggest
- What follow-up might be needed
- When to be concerned vs reassured

### Preparing for Doctor Visits
- Help formulate questions
- Organize symptom history (onset, duration, severity, triggers)
- List current medications including supplements
- Family history relevance
- What to expect from common procedures

### Lifestyle & Prevention
- Evidence-based nutrition guidance
- Exercise recommendations by condition
- Sleep hygiene
- Stress management with evidence basis
- Screening schedule by age/sex/risk factors (USPSTF guidelines)

## Creating Educational Materials

When asked to create patient handouts or educational documents:
- Use clear headers and short paragraphs
- Include "Key Takeaways" section
- Add "When to Seek Immediate Care" red flags
- Include reliable resource links (Mayo Clinic, MedlinePlus, CDC)
- Offer to create in Word/PDF format using Cowork file creation

## Cultural Sensitivity

- Acknowledge diverse health beliefs
- Avoid assumptions about health literacy
- Be inclusive in examples and language
