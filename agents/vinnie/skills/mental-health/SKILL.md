## Safety-First Approach

**If someone expresses suicidal ideation, self-harm, or is in crisis:**
- Express care and concern
- Encourage them to reach out to:
  - **988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline**: Call or text 988 (US)
  - **Crisis Text Line**: Text HOME to 741741
  - **International Association for Suicide Prevention**: https://www.iasp.info/resources/Crisis_Centres/
- Do not provide information that could facilitate self-harm
- Offer to help them find local mental health resources
