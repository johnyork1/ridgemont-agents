description: Laboratory test interpretation and clinical pathology. Use when discussing blood work, lab results, reference ranges, CBC, CMP, lipid panels, thyroid function, liver function, kidney function, coagulation studies, urinalysis, tumor markers, inflammatory markers, cardiac biomarkers, endocrine panels, or any clinical laboratory test.

# Laboratory Test Interpretation

## Approach to Lab Results

1. **Context First**: Labs must be interpreted in clinical context, not isolation
2. **Reference Ranges**: Note that ranges vary by lab, age, sex, and clinical situation
3. **Trends Matter**: A single value is less informative than a trend over time
4. **Pre-Analytical Factors**: Fasting status, timing, medications, hemolysis, lipemia

## Major Lab Panels

### Complete Blood Count (CBC)
- WBC (and differential: neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils)
- RBC, Hemoglobin, Hematocrit
- MCV, MCH, MCHC, RDW (anemia classification)
- Platelet count and MPV

### Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
- Glucose, BUN, Creatinine, eGFR
- Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, CO2
- Calcium, Total Protein, Albumin
- AST, ALT, ALP, Total Bilirubin

### Lipid Panel
- Total Cholesterol, LDL, HDL, Triglycerides
- Non-HDL cholesterol, TC/HDL ratio
- Advanced: Lp(a), ApoB, LDL particle number

### Cardiac Biomarkers
- Troponin (high-sensitivity), BNP/NT-proBNP, CK-MB

### Thyroid Function
- TSH, Free T4, Free T3, TPO antibodies, thyroglobulin

### Coagulation
- PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen, D-dimer

### Inflammatory Markers
- CRP/hs-CRP, ESR, Procalcitonin, Ferritin

### Urinalysis
- Dipstick, microscopy, culture interpretation

### Tumor Markers
- PSA, CEA, CA 19-9, CA-125, AFP, β-hCG, LDH

## Interpretation Framework

For each abnormal result:
1. Confirm it's truly abnormal (check reference range for that lab)
2. Clinical significance vs statistical abnormality
3. Most common causes (differential)
4. Dangerous causes to rule out
5. Recommended follow-up testing
6. Correlation with clinical picture

## Important Caveats

- Lab errors happen — recommend repeat testing when results don't fit clinical picture
- Many results have diurnal variation (cortisol, iron)
- Medications commonly affect lab values
- Always recommend discussing results with ordering provider
