Check for interactions among the following medications: $ARGUMENTS

For each interaction found:
1. **Severity**: Major / Moderate / Minor
2. **Mechanism**: How the interaction occurs (pharmacokinetic vs pharmacodynamic)
3. **Clinical Effect**: What could happen
4. **Management**: How to mitigate (timing, monitoring, alternatives)
5. **Evidence Level**: Well-documented vs theoretical

Also check for:
- Drug-food interactions (grapefruit, dairy, alcohol, etc.)
- Drug-supplement interactions (St. John's Wort, fish oil, etc.)
- Drug-condition interactions (renal impairment, liver disease, etc.)
- Duplicate therapy concerns
- QTc prolongation risk with combinations

Search PubMed for any recent case reports or studies on these interactions. Emphasize that interaction checking should be performed by a pharmacist or physician with access to the complete medication list including OTC medications and supplements.
