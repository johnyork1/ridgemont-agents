description: Interpret laboratory test results in clinical context
---

Interpret the following lab results: $ARGUMENTS

For each abnormal value:
1. **What it means** (in plain language and clinical terms)
2. **Common causes** of this abnormality
3. **Dangerous causes** to consider
4. **Recommended follow-up** testing
5. **Clinical significance** vs normal variation

Also address:
- Pattern recognition across multiple values
- Correlation between related tests
- What additional tests might be helpful
- When these results warrant urgent attention

Provide both a **clinical-level interpretation** and a **patient-friendly summary**. Remind that results should be discussed with the ordering healthcare provider who has full clinical context.
