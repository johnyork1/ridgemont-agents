Conduct a thorough medical literature review on: $ARGUMENTS

Workflow:
1. Search PubMed with targeted queries (use multiple searches if needed)
2. Prioritize: systematic reviews > RCTs > guidelines > cohort studies
3. Also search the web for very recent developments, pre-prints, or news

Deliver a structured research summary:
- **Current State of Evidence** (what we know)
- **Key Studies** (cite PMIDs, note design, sample size, main findings)
- **Clinical Guidelines** (what major bodies recommend)
- **Controversies & Debates** (where experts disagree)
- **Recent Developments** (last 12 months)
- **AI Applications** (if AI/ML is being applied to this area)
- **Knowledge Gaps** (what we still don't know)
- **Practical Takeaways**

Note the level of evidence for each major claim.
