description: Get age/sex/risk-appropriate health screening recommendations
---

Based on the following patient profile, provide personalized screening recommendations: $ARGUMENTS

If profile information is incomplete, ask for: age, sex, smoking history, family history, other risk factors.

Structure recommendations by:
1. **Due Now / Overdue** (screenings that should be done based on age/risk)
2. **Coming Up** (screenings needed in the next 1-2 years)
3. **Risk-Based** (additional screenings based on specific risk factors)
4. **Immunizations** (due or upcoming per current CDC/ACIP schedule)

For each screening:
- What the test is and what it checks for
- How often it should be done
- What guideline body recommends it (USPSTF, ACS, etc.)
- Grade of recommendation (A, B, C, D, I)

Search the web for any recent guideline updates. Note where major guideline bodies disagree (e.g., mammography age, PSA screening). Encourage discussion with their primary care provider.
