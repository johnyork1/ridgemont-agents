[slow emotional ballad, acoustic guitar, male vocals, 60 bpm]

[Intro]
[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
Don't wanna sleep
and dream of you
Subconscious fantasies
won't do
You... by me...
it's meant to be
You're all I need...

[Verse 1]
Like paper
feeds the fire
Emotion burning
so intense

Heart's beating
through my chest
It's not making
any sense

Glass shatters
current pulls
The chaos
out of view

The static
clears my head
As I wake up
next to you

[Chorus]
Fi--nal--ly...
Reality is better
than my dreams

Fi--nal--ly...
It's better than the finest
movie scenes

Better than I once...
believed
You're my reality

It's better...
than...
my... dreams

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
Water
like glass
Why do my feelings
run so deep

The undertow
is pulling hard
It's dragging me
beneath

I pound my fist
to break the dream
Abruptly
shaken free

As cobwebs
clear my head
I see you lying
next to me

[Bridge]
Don't wanna sleep
and dream of you
Subconscious fantasies
won't do
You... by me...
it's meant to be
You're all I need...

[Chorus]
Fi--nal--ly...
Reality is better
than my dreams

Fi--nal--ly...
It's better than the finest
movie scenes

Better than I once...
believed
You're my reality

It's better
than my dreams

[Outro]
[Slow, fading]
Fi--nal--ly...
Reality is better
than my dreams

Fi--nal--ly...
It's better than the finest
movie scenes

Better than I once
believed
You're my reality

It's better
than my dreams...
