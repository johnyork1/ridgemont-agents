[slow melancholic ballad, acoustic guitar, male vocals, 73 bpm]

[Verse 1]
I drink my coffee
extra slow
Truth be known
I'm a tired soul
ooo ooo

Why--yyyy
do I feel
Feel so much agony
and pain
because you've gone
A--way--yyy
oooo
mm mmm

[Bridge]
Jump into the open sea
breaking glass eternally
Crumbling earth
shifting sands
should I give in
to demands

[Verse 2]
I eat my breakfast
when it's cold
Aaaaah ooooo
but I'm getting old

Whee--een
will you save
Save me from this agony
and pain
that you're gone
A--way--yyy
oooo oo ooo

[Bridge]
Conversation
food for thought
contradict the lesson taught
Reaching from
a crowded place
only finding
empty space

[Outro]
Ooooooh
oooooo
I drink my coffee
extra slow
Aaaaah ooooo
I'm getting old...
