## Style Notes
- Lowercase style BUT with proper apostrophes in contractions (don't, isn't, he's, we've, they're — NEVER drop them)
- Acronyms MUST be capitalized: BTC, ETH, SOL, ETF, RSI, GDP, CEO, SEC, CNBC, ARK, AI, S2F, Q4, ATH, DCA, etc.
- No "crypto Twitter" — user prefers "X" terminology
- Short punchy lines, line breaks between points
- Data-driven — cites specific numbers (ETF flows, liquidation amounts)
- Tone: sharp, witty, Norm MacDonald deadpan — not preachy or generic
- "We" energy over "you" energy
- No hashtags, no external links in posts
- Emojis: only 📰 for Today's Notable News header

## Style Edits Log (track John's changes to learn his voice)
- [Feb 7] Prefers not to sound condescending — no "most of you" or "screenshots don't lie"
- [Feb 7] Prefers "we" framing over "you" framing
- [Feb 7] First draft was rejected as "too flat/generic" — needs actual wit, misdirects, deadpan humor
- [Feb 7] Batch approval then fully automated execution — never ask "next"
- [Feb 10] Proper grammar is non-negotiable — always use apostrophes in contractions. Acronyms always capitalized. Dropping apostrophes "goes against his nature"

### Feb 5 — 3h ago
some perspective on the "crash"
btc down 40% from october highs. brutal
weve seen 80%+ drawdowns before. 2018. 2022.
the difference: institutions are involved now. changes cascade dynamics
volatility is the price of admission
(Views: 10)

### Feb 5 — 9h ago
genuine question for crypto twitter:
at what price would you start buying again?
- below $70K?
- below $60K?
- waiting for ETF flows to reverse?
- already buying?
no wrong answers. just curious where everyones head is at
(Views: 11)

### Feb 5 — 12h ago
$818 million left Bitcoin ETFs in a single day
BlackRock led with $318M out. Fidelity $215M. ARK $142M
this isnt retail panic. its institutional risk-off
when the big money runs, you pay attention
(Views: 24)

### Feb 4 — 14h ago
Michael Burry predicted 2008. now hes warning about Bitcoin
his concern: 44% of BTC supply is underwater. cascading liquidations arent just a crypto problem anymore — theyre a Wall Street problem
buying this dip or waiting for lower?
(Views: 36)

### Feb 4 — 20h ago (7-part thread)
1. 🚨 Bitcoin just crashed below $73K — but the real story isnt the price — its WHO is selling and WHY. heres whats actually happening:
2-5. [thread body]
6. so what do you do? not financial advice, but heres my take: dont panic sell. dont over-leverage. and definitely dont invest money you cant afford to lose. volatility is the price of admission
7. this isnt the first 40% drop and wont be the last. but watch the ETF flows. when institutions stop selling, thats your signal. follow for daily crypto updates. drop a comment — buying or waiting?

## Feb 7, 2026 — Morning Quote Posts (from earlier session)

### QP — Quoting @WalkerAmerica (POSTED ~10:55 AM PT)
agree with the sentiment but this misses something
most people selling right now arent choosing to. theyre getting liquidated because they over-leveraged.
understanding what you own doesnt help when your position gets force-closed at 3am

### QP — Quoting @dangambardello (POSTED ~11:48 AM PT)
surviving a 44% drawdown from ATH isnt about being smart. its about having a plan before it happened.
no plan = emotional decisions. thats the real filter.

### QP — Quoting @antmillionsbot (POSTED ~12:45 PM PT)
72 hours. $30K gone. and the wildest part?
most of the selling wasnt even human. it was algorithms liquidating positions that were built on other leveraged positions.
rehypothecated leverage is the part nobody talks about. the same collateral backing multiple bets. when one unwinds, they all do.
this wasnt a crash. it was a margin call on an entire market structure.

### QP — Quoting @JureKaramarko (POSTED ~1:38 PM PT)
people leaving Cardano while CME futures launch in 3 days
institutions are literally building on-ramps to ADA while retail is running for the exit
the timing is almost poetic. panic at the exact moment infrastructure arrives

### QP — Quoting @AltcoinDaily (POSTED ~2:30 PM PT)
man said he lost $3 billion and his response was to sell his jet and his lambo to keep funding development
thats not diamond hands. thats a different kind of conviction.
most people cant stomach a $500 loss. this guy liquidated his lifestyle to keep building. whether you hold ADA or not, that says something.

https://x.com/status/2020285793001181409
gemini just shut down in 3 countries, fired 25% of their staff, and pivoted to prediction markets and ai
thats not a pivot. thats a company playing musical chairs and the music stopped twice

### QP2 — Quoting @PeterSchiff (SCHEDULED ~4:47 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/PeterSchiff/status/2019510654772609100
peter schiff has declared bitcoin dead more times than bitcoin has actually crashed
at this point hes not a bear. hes a feature. every cycle needs someone who confidently says "this time its really over" so the rest of us know it isnt

### POST 4 — RSI Deadpan (SCHEDULED ~5:22 PM PT)
bitcoins rsi is at 15. thats lower than march 2020 when the entire global economy shut down
back then the world was literally ending
now its just a tuesday where everyone is overleveraged
somehow the indicator doesnt know the difference

### QP3 — Quoting @Sherlockwhale (SCHEDULED ~6:07 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/Sherlockwhale/status/2019394093797757314
love this take. very clean data. except the pattern also predicted 2022 would only drop 70% and it dropped 77%
38k is possible. so is 55k. so is btc doing something nobody predicted because thats literally what it does every cycle

### POST 5 — ETF Underwater (SCHEDULED ~6:57 PM PT)
the average bitcoin etf holder got in at 84k. btc is at 69k
so now we have institutions calling their risk analysts the same way retail calls their ex at 2am
"i know i said id be disciplined this time"

### QP4 — Quoting @Washigorira (SCHEDULED ~7:47 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/Washigorira/status/2020201389696352738
"i dont know" is the most valuable three words in crypto right now and almost nobody is saying them
respect

### POST 6 — Bitfarms (SCHEDULED ~8:37 PM PT)
bitfarms used to be a bitcoin company. now they want to be an ai company
which is like a fisherman saying actually im a marine biologist. same ocean but the linkedin is different

### QP5 — Quoting @BitcoinJunkies (SCHEDULED ~9:32 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/BitcoinJunkies/status/2020177852864352576
peter schiff saying bitcoin will never hit a million dollars is the most reliable buy signal weve had since the fear and greed index

### POST 7 — USDC vs USDT (SCHEDULED ~10:32 PM PT)
usdc grew 73% last year. outpaced tether for the second year running
people arent leaving stablecoins. theyre leaving the one with the mystery audit

### POST 8 — Fear & Greed Confessional (SCHEDULED ~11:32 PM PT)
honestly the fear and greed index at 8 doesnt tell me when to buy. it tells me how scared everyone is. those are two different things
everyone who bought the last time it was this low looks like a genius now. they didnt feel like geniuses at the time. they felt exactly like we do right now

### POST 9 — Polymarket (SCHEDULED ~12:32 AM PT)
polymarket says 69% chance btc stays under 70k this month
also says 54% chance it clears 100k by december
the market is literally betting on two opposite outcomes at the same time and calling it price discovery

### POST 10 — Infrastructure/Stablecoins (MANUAL — for John to post via X app) [IMAGE: post_infrastructure_quote.png]
the wildest thing about this crash isnt the crash
its that 33 trillion dollars moved through stablecoins last year. exchanges processed every transaction. wallets kept working. the whole system ran perfectly while the price did whatever the price does
most things break under stress. this one just got busier
hard to call that a mania ending

Quoting: https://x.com/CorySwan/status/2020226484603089055
love the data. the part that jumps out is every single crash above this one on the list was followed by a new all time high
the 94% crash in 2011? btc was at $2. its at 70k now
9th worst sounds scary until you realize the other 8 turned out fine

### POST 2 — SEC Regulatory Shift (SCHEDULED ~4:05 PM PT) [IMAGE: post_sec_quote.png]
the sec went from suing every crypto company to dropping almost every case in the span of one new chairman
gary gensler was apparently a feature not a permanent installation

Quoting: https://x.com/Bitcoin_Teddy/status/2020136339409367299
the numbers here are wild but the craziest part is nobody designed this
nobody sat in a room and said lets steal 93% of peoples purchasing power. it just happened. slowly. over 50 years. while everyone was busy arguing about other stuff
bitcoin wasnt invented to make people rich. it was invented because this math exists

### POST 3 — ETH vs BTC Dominance (SCHEDULED ~5:25 PM PT) [IMAGE: post_btc_dominance_stat.png]
eth is down 22% this week while btc is down 10%
every cycle someone says "this is the time eth flips btc" and every crash btc just calmly extends its lead like a marathoner who hasnt even started sweating yet
btc dominance at 60%. eth dominance at existential crisis

man asked for bitcoin as a birthday gift while btc is down 52% from the top
either thats the most thoughtful thing anyones ever said or the most expensive birthday hint in history
probably both

### POST 5 — Putin Quote (SCHEDULED ~8:05 PM PT)
putin said "who can ban bitcoin? nobody" this week
honestly hearing that from the guy who banned most things in his own country is either the most bullish signal or the weirdest endorsement in the history of finance
when the person best known for banning stuff says your thing cant be banned maybe pay attention

### QP5 — Quoting @0xFinish (SCHEDULED ~8:45 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/0xFinish/status/2020150601200594952
"this is a deliberate attack on crypto" is a sentence that gets posted after literally every 30%+ drop since 2013
sometimes the explanation is just: a bunch of overleveraged positions got liquidated and then more overleveraged positions got liquidated
not everything is a conspiracy. some things are just math

### POST 6 — Illinois Bitcoin Reserve (SCHEDULED ~9:25 PM PT)
illinois just introduced a bitcoin reserve bill
a state that cant balance its pension fund wants to hold bitcoin
either this is the smartest hedge theyve ever made or someone in springfield watched one too many michael saylor interviews

### POST 7 — Drawdown Meditative (SCHEDULED ~10:05 PM PT)
the weirdest thing about a 52% drawdown is how familiar it feels
same headlines. same fear. same people saying its over for good this time
the only thing thats different is we have more data now. and the data says the same thing it always said: this is normal. ugly. but normal

### DIRECT POST 1 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
bitcoin has crashed 52% from the top and the sec picked this exact moment to stop suing everyone

### DIRECT POST 2 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
stablecoin inflows doubled to 102 billion per week during the crash
people arent leaving crypto. theyre just moving to the part of crypto that doesnt make them check their phone at 3am
turns out the most popular crypto product is "bitcoin but without the feelings"

### REPLY 1 — reply to @CorySwan (MANUAL)
https://x.com/CorySwan/status/2020226484603089055
the 2025-26 entry being dead last on this list is somehow both comforting and insulting at the same time

### REPLY 2 — reply to @0xFinish (MANUAL)
https://x.com/0xFinish/status/2020150601200594952
respect the conviction but "deliberate attack" does a lot of heavy lifting when the simpler explanation is 150x leverage on leverage

strategy now holds 314,025 bitcoin. bought 1,142 more this week at 95k average
meanwhile cango sold 4,451 btc to pivot to ai
one company is accumulating the hardest asset ever created. the other traded it for graphics cards
in 5 years one of these decisions will look obvious. the fun part is both sides think its theirs

### DIRECT POST 2 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
gold at 5,000. bitcoin at 69k. the fed being questioned by congress. etfs bleeding billions
and somehow the most controversial thing that happened today was a super bowl commercial
we are not a serious financial system

the consistency is almost unsettling at this point. buying through every dip like its a subscription service

this is the post that bridges the gap between crypto people and everyone else. housing is the one thing nobody can argue about

### QP1 — Quoting @saylor (SCHEDULED 10:40 AM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/saylor/status/2020486871394992570
the man posted "orange dots matter" while sitting on a 5 billion dollar unrealized loss
most ceos would be quietly updating their resume. this one is making art with purchase dots
saylor isnt a bitcoin investor anymore. hes a bitcoin geological formation. he was here before us and hell be here after

### POST 2 — Strategy Q4 Loss (SCHEDULED 11:20 AM PT) [IMAGE: post_strategy_loss_stat.png]
strategy posted a 12.6 billion dollar loss last quarter
for context thats more than the gdp of madagascar
messari compared it to aig and fannie mae during the 2008 financial crisis
saylors response: bought 1,142 more bitcoin this week
the man looked at a number that would make most boards of directors physically ill and said "more orange dots"

### QP2 — Quoting @CryptoMichNL (SCHEDULED 12:00 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/2019443042243977531
rsi at 18. fear and greed at 5. both levels weve only seen during covid and the 2018 bottom
the data is screaming that this is either a generational buying opportunity or the end of everything
no pressure

### POST 3 — Cathie Wood Rotation (SCHEDULED 12:40 PM PT)
cathie wood dumped 39 million in coinbase shares and bought a crypto exchange called bullish
not bullish on coinbase. bullish the company. its literally called bullish
when the woman famous for buying the top sells a stock thats already down 48% thats either brilliant timing or proof that even ark invest has a plan b
coinbase earnings in two days. this is either prophetic or petty

### QP3 — Quoting @JacobKinge (SCHEDULED 1:20 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/JacobKinge/status/2020010325999849750
an anonymous person on 4chan predicted bitcoins exact top to the day. two years in advance
meanwhile wall street analysts with phds and bloomberg terminals cant agree on whether btc will be at 38k or 150k next month
the prediction market isnt broken. it just doesnt work the way we thought. turns out the alpha was on a message board next to a thread about whether hot dogs are sandwiches

### POST 4 — Vitalik Sold ETH (SCHEDULED 2:00 PM PT)
vitalik sold 2,972 eth worth 6.7 million while the market was crashing
"its for charity" he said. which is technically true. everything is charity when you sell during a 25% weekly drawdown
eth is down 33% this week. sol is down 72% from peak. btc is down 52% from the top
and the guy who built one of them chose this moment to lighten up
im not reading into it. im just reading it

### QP4 — Quoting @100trillionUSD (SCHEDULED 2:40 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/100trillionUSD/status/1980259495902109832
planb saying bears are wrong about the cycle is the most planb thing that has ever happened
the s2f model predicted 100k by end of 2021 and we got there in 2024. close enough if you squint
hes either the most patient analyst alive or the only one honest enough to say "the model works it just doesnt have a calendar"

### POST 5 — Fear & Greed All-Time Low (SCHEDULED 3:20 PM PT) [IMAGE: post_fear_greed_stat.png]
fear and greed index hit 5 this week. thats the lowest reading in its entire history
lower than covid. lower than ftx. lower than the time everyone thought tether was about to collapse
and btc is at 68k. not 20k. not 3k. 68k
we are more scared at 68 thousand dollars than we were when the entire financial system was shutting down
sentiment is a hell of a drug

### QP5 — Quoting @CoinCornerDanny (SCHEDULED 4:00 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/CoinCornerDanny/status/2021241917757964485
this is the part nobody talks about
etf demand showed up during a bull run. retail fomo showed up during a bull run. but never at the same time
when those two forces overlap for the first time it either sends btc to a number we cant even model or its already priced in
probably the first one though

### POST 6 — Solana Collapse (SCHEDULED 4:40 PM PT)
solana is down 72% from its cycle peak. trading at 88 dollars
an analyst just predicted it could go to 40
remember when sol was the "ethereum killer?" now its being killed by a market that doesnt discriminate
every cycle has a "this time its different" coin. every crash reminds us that it wasnt

### POST 7 — Coinbase Earnings Preview (SCHEDULED 5:20 PM PT)
coinbase reports earnings thursday. stock is down 48% in 6 months
cathie wood just sold 39 million worth of it. ark invest hasnt sold coinbase since august
analysts expect 83 cents per share and 1.86 billion in revenue
if they beat: nobody will care because the market is in extreme fear
if they miss: everyone will care because the market is in extreme fear
heads they lose. tails they also lose. welcome to reporting earnings during a crash

### DIRECT POST 1 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
the crypto market has lost 900 billion dollars in 22 days
scaramucci went on cnbc and said "theres nothing going on that should have necessitated this type of crash"
hes right. and thats the scariest part. there wasnt a single event. just leverage unwinding into more leverage unwinding into fear into more fear
the market doesnt need a reason. it just needs a direction

### DIRECT POST 2 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
google searches for "capitulation" are up 427% this week
which means people are googling the word for "giving up" to figure out if everyone else has given up yet
if thats not the most perfectly human response to a market crash i dont know what is
we dont even know how to surrender without checking if its trending first

### REPLY 1 — reply to @saylor (MANUAL)
https://x.com/saylor/status/2020486871394992570
posting a dot chart while sitting on a 5 billion dollar loss is the most serene thing ive ever seen in finance

### REPLY 2 — reply to @CryptoMichNL (MANUAL)
https://x.com/CryptoMichNL/status/2019443042243977531
rsi at 18 and fear at 5. last time both hit these levels simultaneously the market bottomed within weeks. not a guarantee but its worth noting

### POST 1 — Today's Notable News (SCHEDULED 10:00 AM PT) [IMAGE: post_news_header_feb11.png]
todays notable news 📰
BTC at $67,100. down 2.2% overnight. fear and greed index at 12 — up from 6 over the weekend but still deeper fear than COVID or FTX
Cash App just removed ALL fees on large Bitcoin purchases and Lightning transactions
White House holding closed-door meeting TODAY on stablecoin regulation — key fight is whether holders can earn interest
Bitcoin ETFs pulled in $145 million on Feb 9 — first net inflow in weeks. outflow streak broken
whales dumped 89,000 BTC since mid-January but added 3,800 back in the last 24 hours
Bernstein reaffirmed their $150,000 BTC target for end of 2026 despite the 47% pullback

### QP1 — Quoting @saylor (SCHEDULED 10:40 AM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/saylor/status/2021591432872493220
Saylor posting a Spinal Tap reference while his company is down $12.6 billion in a single quarter is genuinely the most Michael Saylor thing I've ever seen
the man lost more money than most countries have and his response is a guitar amp joke
this is either peak delusion or peak conviction and honestly at this point the difference doesn't matter. he's not selling. that's the whole story

### POST 2 — White House Stablecoin Meeting (SCHEDULED 11:20 AM PT)
the White House is holding a closed-door meeting today about whether stablecoin holders should be allowed to earn interest
banks say no. crypto companies say yes
the actual question nobody's asking: why does the government need a meeting to decide if you can earn 4% on your own money
we put a man on the moon 57 years ago but letting people earn yield on a dollar is apparently a policy crisis

### QP2 — Quoting @pete_rizzo_ (SCHEDULED 12:00 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/pete_rizzo_/status/2021515048837890388
Jack Dorsey removing Bitcoin fees while the market is in extreme fear is the equivalent of putting a "free samples" sign outside during a hurricane
nobody's walking in right now. but when the storm passes they'll remember who left the door open
zero fees on Lightning is the part that matters most. that's not a promotion. that's infrastructure

### POST 3 — $2 Trillion Market Cap Loss (SCHEDULED 12:40 PM PT) [IMAGE: post_quote_market_cap_feb11.png]
the crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since October
that's the GDP of Italy. gone in four months
total market cap went from $4.27 trillion to $2.4 trillion. not a correction. a redistribution
and somehow the conversation is quieter now than it was during the $500 billion NFT run-up. losses don't go viral. gains do
that's the real asymmetry in this market. not the price. the attention

### QP3 — Quoting @TedPillows (SCHEDULED 1:20 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/TedPillows/status/2021602406350373252
Kalshi traders predicting BTC at $49K is the prediction market version of a bar fight
everyone's placing bets. nobody's thinking clearly. and the guy who actually knows what happens next isn't in the room
four months ago the consensus was $200K. now it's $49K. the consensus is always wrong at the extremes. that's what makes them extremes

### POST 4 — Novogratz: Age of Speculation Over (SCHEDULED 2:00 PM PT)
Mike Novogratz saying crypto's "age of speculation" is over is interesting because he said it while BTC is down 47% from the top
the age of speculation isn't over. it just got expensive
speculation ends when people stop guessing what's next. we haven't stopped guessing. we've just gotten quieter about it
the loudest rooms get quiet when losses are real. that doesn't mean the game changed. it means the scoreboard got updated

### QP4 — Quoting @Bitcoin_Teddy (SCHEDULED 2:40 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/Bitcoin_Teddy/status/2020677258030059786
12% of 30-year-olds own a home and are married. it was 52% in 1960
and people wonder why an entire generation decided to gamble on internet money
Bitcoin isn't competing with gold. it's competing with a system that priced out everyone under 40 from every traditional path to wealth
the speculation isn't irrational. the starting conditions are

### POST 5 — Fear & Greed Index (SCHEDULED 3:20 PM PT) [IMAGE: post_fear_greed_feb11.png]
fear and greed went from 6 to 12 in 48 hours
the good news: we doubled
the bad news: we doubled from the lowest reading in the index's entire history
at 12 we're still in deeper fear than the March 2020 COVID crash. deeper than FTX. deeper than every crypto winter before this one
and BTC is at $67K. not $20K. not $3K
either the index is broken or we've collectively decided that $67,000 Bitcoin is scarier than a global pandemic. both options are fascinating

### QP5 — Quoting @TedPillows (SCHEDULED 4:00 PM PT)
Quoting: https://x.com/TedPillows/status/2021607311597289592
one person deposited $340 million in BTC on Binance and dropped the price $3,000 each time
that's not trading. that's a controlled demolition
the fact that a single wallet can move a $1.3 trillion asset by 4% tells you everything about where the real liquidity is right now. it isn't here
thin order books + concentrated holdings = a market that can be shoved around by anyone with enough zeros

### POST 6 — ETF Inflows Return (SCHEDULED 4:40 PM PT)
Bitcoin ETFs just pulled in $145 million in net inflows on February 9
that broke a multi-week outflow streak. two positive days in a row
it's not a flood. it's a trickle. but trickles matter when everyone else is running for the exits
the interesting part: retail is panic selling while institutions are quietly re-entering. this exact dynamic has preceded every major reversal in the ETF era
doesn't mean it happens again. just means the pattern is familiar

### POST 7 — Bernstein $150K Target (SCHEDULED 5:20 PM PT)
Bernstein just reaffirmed their $150,000 BTC target for end of 2026
the asset is down 47% from highs and they didn't flinch
Wall Street price targets are usually worth about as much as a fortune cookie. but when a firm doubles down during a crash instead of quietly revising lower that says something
either they know something we don't or they're too committed to the call to walk it back
both are equally possible on Wall Street. that's what makes it interesting

### DIRECT POST 1 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
the White House is having a meeting today about whether you should be allowed to earn interest on your own stablecoins
banks are lobbying against it. the same banks that pay you 0.01% on your savings account while lending your money out at 7%
the system works perfectly. just not for you

### DIRECT POST 2 (MANUAL — for John to post via X app)
whales dumped 89,000 BTC since mid-January. then quietly bought 3,800 back in the last 24 hours
the dump was loud. the re-entry was silent
that's always how it works. the selling gets headlines. the buying gets done in the dark

zero fees on Lightning during a crash is the kind of move that looks like nothing now and genius in 12 months
