Then say:

## TIPS FOR BEST RESULTS

1. **Always attach your reference images** — ChatGPT needs them every new conversation to maintain style consistency.

2. **If style drifts**, say: *"The style is drifting from the reference. Make them more cartoon/sticker-like with thick outlines, matching the exact proportions and colors from my reference sheets."*

3. **If characters look different**, say: *"Weeter should be a rounder brown bear with round ears and a big nose. Blubby should be a smaller yellow-green creature with antennae and big round eyes. Check the reference images."*

4. **If the grid is too crowded**, reduce to 4 poses per sheet instead of 6.

5. **If backgrounds aren't clean white**, say: *"Make the background pure solid white (#FFFFFF) with no gradients, shadows, or textures."*

6. **Save all images to:** `X-Posts/Weeter_and_Blubby/` folder
