## Post 1 — Macro angle (post midday)

everyone keeps asking "why is BTC crashing"

its not one thing. its everything at once:

new Fed chair leans hawkish. tariff threats on multiple fronts. Treasury Secretary saying the government wont step in to save crypto.

this isnt a crypto problem. its a risk-off environment. BTC is just the loudest indicator

## Post 2 — Builder/contrarian angle (post afternoon)

stablecoins processed more volume last month than in all of 2021

web3 gaming studios are finally building for sustainability instead of hype

infrastructure is growing while prices are shrinking

bear markets are ugly. but theyre also where the next cycle gets built

## Post 3 — Data-driven close (post evening)

Fear & Greed just hit 5.

ETFs bought 46,000 BTC this time last year. now theyre net sellers.

$1.5B liquidated in 24 hours. $1T wiped since mid-January.

the crowd doesnt flip this fast because fundamentals changed. they flip because pain changed their mind.

zoom out. weve been here before.
