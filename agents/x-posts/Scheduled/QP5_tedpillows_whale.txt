A whale is trying to do max damage to $BTC price. Just today, he has deposited $340,000,000 in $BTC on Binance in 2 transactions. After each transaction, Bitcoin has dropped $2,700-$3,000 in a few hours.

one person deposited $340 million in BTC on Binance and dropped the price $3,000 each time

that's not trading. that's a controlled demolition

the fact that a single wallet can move a $1.3 trillion asset by 4% tells you everything about where the real liquidity is right now. it isn't here

thin order books + concentrated holdings = a market that can be shoved around by anyone with enough zeros
