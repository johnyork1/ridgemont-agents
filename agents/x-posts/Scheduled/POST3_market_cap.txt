the crypto market has lost $2 trillion in value since October

that's the GDP of Italy. gone in four months

total market cap went from $4.27 trillion to $2.4 trillion. not a correction. a redistribution

and somehow the conversation is quieter now than it was during the $500 billion NFT run-up. losses don't go viral. gains do

that's the real asymmetry in this market. not the price. the attention
