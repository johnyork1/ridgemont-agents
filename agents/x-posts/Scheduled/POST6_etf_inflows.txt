POST 6 — ETF Inflows Return
Scheduled: 16:40 PST

Bitcoin ETFs just pulled in $145 million in net inflows on February 9

that broke a multi-week outflow streak. two positive days in a row

it's not a flood. it's a trickle. but trickles matter when everyone else is running for the exits

the interesting part: retail is panic selling while institutions are quietly re-entering. this exact dynamic has preceded every major reversal in the ETF era

doesn't mean it happens again. just means the pattern is familiar
