POST 2 — White House Stablecoin Meeting
Scheduled: 11:20 PST

the White House is holding a closed-door meeting today about whether stablecoin holders should be allowed to earn interest

banks say no. crypto companies say yes

the actual question nobody's asking: why does the government need a meeting to decide if you can earn 4% on your own money

we put a man on the moon 57 years ago but letting people earn yield on a dollar is apparently a policy crisis
