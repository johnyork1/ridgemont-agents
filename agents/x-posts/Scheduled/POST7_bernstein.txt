POST 7 — Bernstein $150K Target
Scheduled: 17:20 PST

Bernstein just reaffirmed their $150,000 BTC target for end of 2026

the asset is down 47% from highs and they didn't flinch

Wall Street price targets are usually worth about as much as a fortune cookie. but when a firm doubles down during a crash instead of quietly revising lower that says something

either they know something we don't or they're too committed to the call to walk it back

both are equally possible on Wall Street. that's what makes it interesting
