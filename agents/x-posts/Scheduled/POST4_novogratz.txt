POST 4 — Novogratz: Age of Speculation Over
Scheduled: 14:00 PST

Mike Novogratz saying crypto's "age of speculation" is over is interesting because he said it while BTC is down 47% from the top

the age of speculation isn't over. it just got expensive

speculation ends when people stop guessing what's next. we haven't stopped guessing. we've just gotten quieter about it

the loudest rooms get quiet when losses are real. that doesn't mean the game changed. it means the scoreboard got updated
