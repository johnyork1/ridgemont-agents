fear and greed went from 6 to 12 in 48 hours

the good news: we doubled
the bad news: we doubled from the lowest reading in the index's entire history

at 12 we're still in deeper fear than the March 2020 COVID crash. deeper than FTX. deeper than every crypto winter before this one

and BTC is at $67K. not $20K. not $3K

either the index is broken or we've collectively decided that $67,000 Bitcoin is scarier than a global pandemic. both options are fascinating
