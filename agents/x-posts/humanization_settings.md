## Anti-Detection Rules

1. **Never** post at exact intervals
2. **Vary** content length (some short, some long)
3. **Mix** content types (don't batch similar posts)
4. **Engage** with others before self-promoting
5. **Respond** to replies (even briefly)
6. **Occasionally** make corrections in replies ("*their" fixing a typo)
